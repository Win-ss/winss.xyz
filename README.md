Hi! so real quick this is a website for my projects

Dustlab: A webapp that turns images and 3d models to particles using mcfunctions, with json support for soon to be released plugin.

Wink: A simple image editor with a unique twist. Features like snapshot and blink that lets you save your edits and "animate" your image with them (pretty good for making animated profiles ig ðŸ‘€)

transparency: made with the help of ai, about 40% ish.
